# CEO Log - 2026-02-02

## Vision Creation (v1)

**Action**: Defined the initial company vision following the strategy pivot.

**Rationale**:
The board made it clear that we need to move away from low-value chat interfaces and towards high-value, action-oriented agency. The "Executive Agent" concept targets this need directly. We are positioning this as a high-ticket B2B play.

**Decisions**:
- **Pivot**: Shifted focus to "Autonomous Execution".
- **Pricing**: Defined as "High-Ticket" model (aiming for $50k+ contracts).
- **First Milestone**: We need a working MVP that does *one* thing perfectly reliable.

**Next Steps**:
- CTO to define architecture to support autonomous execution loops.
- PM to break down the MVP requirements.
